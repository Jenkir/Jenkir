Founder of Cherry Tree Lane Analytics which specializes in providing curated, low-cost ESG and impact investing data. 

Corporate activities have such a huge impact on the world that we live in - transparency and accountability for those activities is crucial. ESG ("Environmental, Social, Governance issues") metrics are used to measure the extent of these activities as well as to evaluate whether to invest in a company . A few examples of ESG metrics are: how much pollution a company causes, how equitable their hiring practices are, and whether their board has adequate oversight. Obviously, we can only see if progress is being made if we are collecting, tracking, and analyzing data related to these activities.

At this time, ESG data can be a hodge-podge, although, it is becoming more streamlined and structured. 
It can be difficult to find low-cost or free ESG data aggregated in one place, especially for those who aren't data or ESG experts.
To fill that gap, Cherry Tree Lane Analytics, through the [ESG Data Shop](https://esgdatashop.io/), provides data that has been extracted from multiple sites including [ESGAnalytics.io](https://www.esganalytics.io/), Finazon.io, and Yahoo Finance. We clean, aggregate, and organize the data into categories (such as companies in the S&P 500 or companies in a certain industry sector). We then provide the datasets in the form of downloadable spreadsheets. 

Prior to Cherry Tree Lane Analytics, I worked as a Data Analyst at the Baltimore Development Corporation (BDC), the economic development agency for Baltimore City. I have also worked in development at an environmental nonprofit, Blue Water Baltimore and was the owner of Baltimore Garden Company which specialized in designing and installing landscapes in urban settings. I earned a Bachelor's degree in Landscape Architecture from the University of Maryland, College Park and a Bachelor's degree in English from Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC. I earned a Data Analytics certificate from Johns Hopkins University in 2021.

Technical skills include Excel, Python, MongoDB, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Jupyter Notebooks, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Wordpress. I have experience with Javascript and Machine Learning as well.

In my spare time, I volunteer at the [Baltimore Animal Rescue Center](https://www.barcs.org/) and enjoy many outdoor activities such as water sports and skiing. You'll also find me picking up litter around the neighborhood and using [Litterati](https://www.litterati.org/) to record which companies originally produced the litter that has now ended up along our streets!

I live with my husband, two cats (Katrina and Plato), and our rescue dog (Zena) in Baltimore, MD USA.
