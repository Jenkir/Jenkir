Founder of Cherry Tree Lane Analytics which specializes in providing curate, low-cost ESG and impact investing data. 

While I've been involved with investing for over 20 years, I became more interested in data related to Environmental-Social-Governance (ESG) factors while working as a data and research analyst at Baltimore Development Corporation (BDC), the economic development agency for Baltimore City, Maryland. Corporate activities have such a huge impact on the world that we live in - transparency and accountability for those activities is crucial. These activities have effects on the environment - such as pollution, social considerations - such as hiring practices, and corporate governance - such as corruption. Obviously, we can only see if we are making progress on any of these factors if we are collecting, tracking, and analyzing data related to them.

At this time, ESG data can be a hodge-podge, although, thankfully, it is becoming more streamlined and structured. 
It can be difficult to find low-cost or free ESG data aggregated in one place, especially for those who aren't data or ESG experts.
To fill that gap, Cherry Tree Lane Analytics, in the form of the [ESG Data Shop](https://esgdatashop.io/), provides data that has been extracted from multiple sites including [ESGAnalytics.io](https://www.esganalytics.io/), cleaned, aggregated, and put into downloadable spreadsheets. 

Prior to working at BDC, I worked at an environmental nonprofit and was the owner of Baltimore Garden Company which specialized in designing and installing landscapes in urban settings. I earned a Bachelor's degree in Landscape Architecture from the University of Maryland, College Park and a Bachelor's degree in English from Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC. I earned a Data Analytics certificate from Johns Hopkins University.

Technical skills include experience with Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Jupyter Notebooks, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Wordpress.

In my spare time, I volunteer at the [Baltimore Animal Rescue Center](https://www.barcs.org/) and spend a lot of time outdoors doing everything from skiing to picking up litter in the neighborhood!
I live with my husband, two cats (Katrina and Plato), and our rescue dog (Zena) in Baltimore, MD USA.
